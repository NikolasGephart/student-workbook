### Date - 6/24/21


## Day Overview
This was the first day where we got the closest thing to a break that we will be getting in this class. It was review day, a day to recap everything we covered earlier in the week and get a mini project in oreder to prectice what we learned. My partner and I decided to share the project over github and that was difficult to figure out and took almost an hour but we eventually got it working. I felt that I didn't make nearly as much progress as I was expecting and should have talked to the TA's more to better understand what I was doing and why I had to do ceartan things.


## What is the purpose of wire-framing?

  Wire framing allows the developer or sight builder to plan how the sight will look in a rapid prototyping way where the client can approve or provide feedback on it's design. Wire-framing also gives the sight its structure and plans it's functionality. 

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

<ul>
  <li><strong>Low Fidelity</strong></li>
    <p>This is the roughest of rough sketches when it comes to planning on how to design the sight. This is as if you met someone in a coffee shop, got talking about how you build websites and they give you a design on a napkin</p>
  <li><strong>Mid Fidelity</strong></li>
    <p>This is still a sketch but has a higher focus on detail than the low fidelity version has. This version is the kind you will sketch up with a client during a meeting discussing what they wish the final design to look like</p>
  <li><strong>High Fidelity</strong></li>
    <p>This version will look like a carbon copy of the sight. Besides the functionality and some minor details missing the high fidelity mockup will look as if it were screen grabbed from the final product. This version will most likely be used as refrence material when coding due to it's detail.</p>
</ul>

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

  I belive wire-frames are worth the time and energy not only because you will have something that very closely resembles the final product, allowing you to simply copy the design but it gives you the opertunity to make sure your client enjoys the design and quicky make changes without large time commitments.
