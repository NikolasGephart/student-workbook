# Intro to Codeworks (Day 1)

The day started out very relaxed with the TA's and instructors doing a quick game of two truths and a lie as a sort of ice breaker in order to get everyone a little more comfortable with each other and more ok with speaking. The instructors and TA's went first and we (the new students) went after them.

The pace and content of the class only picked up from there. The rest of the day went as follows.

    1. Syllabus and Attendance 
    2. Discussing what is scrum and how to effectively use it
    3. Lunch
    4. Where tasks and projects can be found
    5. Setting Up a new project
    6. Resources
    7. Using Git
    8. Setting Up the Journal

## In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use Git as an efficient way to document changes to code and access it from different devices and accounts. It also allows for accurate documentation of changes/edits by who and when. This gives incredible accuracy in tracking contributions by group members or individuals.

## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Having multiple branches allows for different group members working on the same project to create what they believe to be the most effective solution to a problem and compare to each other's code allowing them to implement the most effective version. Having multiple branches also allows the group to work on different segments of the same project simultaneously for quicker development and testing.

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub

As I currently understand it, Git is a locally installed and mostly command line controlled version of the software. GitHub however is a browser based version of the software allowing for an easy to use GUI and browsing of other branches. This also gives GitHub the unique ability to allow it's users to browse other people's projects on the site.
