## Overview of Day
So far the day has started out by a former student coming in to talk about their time in the class and giving good tips on what to expect from the class and how to best go through it. After a quick break and two fun videos (The Expert) we went over what our checkpoint should look like. The checkpoint is us attempting to copy a website template from a picture showing how the different cards move depending on if it is in web or mobile view.


## Reflection after first day
This project in practice is much harder than it looked. Trying to remember the different examples given about how to use bootsrap while giving it enough css to show up and not be clear but not get lost in design while also wondering why your rows are acting more like columns than anything else gets a bit overwhelming. I eventualy reached a point where I was stuck and my own confusion and stress was only slowing me down instead of helping at all.
