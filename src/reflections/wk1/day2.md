# Date - 6/22/21

Today the class started with an understanding CSS challenge/warmup. IT was a series of progressively more complicated css questions in order to specifically target parts of your HTML code. This later transitioned into the instructor covering building a basic website using HTML and CSS. After a basic sight page was made we were then introduced to FlexBox as an easier way to orient and style the HTML. As our project for the rest of the day we were shown a picture of a basic sight page with a double column layout and told to try our best to recreate it. It was definitely a struggle at the beginning involving me completely scrapping my first project(still shown on github)and starting a second version which turned out significantly better. It wasn’t great by any means but it still was much better.


# What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

Pseudo Classes are classes of which can change their importance value. This allows them to originally not be used because another class has a higher importance but raises it's importance if the correct conditions are met. I believe the Pseudo-Classes that I will be using the most in the future are “hover, before, and after” because it allows for more interactivity and feedback to the user. One example I can think of is allowing a CSS button to change colors when being hovered over by the cursor.

# What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is how CSS prioritises contradicting commands. If there were two instances of CSS trying to set the background color but each of the instances said a different color specificity would allow CSS to choose a color instead of receiving a blue screen of death. Using specificity can allow you to use the same class name for different parts of your HTML and still have CSS assign different colors to the tags even with the same class name.

# What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

The biggest issue I can see from becoming overly reliant on !important is that the code could run into many issues from having hard set values that never change especially if two !important values were contradicting each other.
