## Overview of Day
 This morning had a bit of a different kind of start to it. This morning started with some whiteboard challenges. The first one was solved fairly easily and quickly by our team (go team 3) while the second problem used up a lot more mental bandwidth than was expected. We ended up coming up with an overly complicated but still kinda correct solution. The actual solution was still clever and fun to hear too. The rest of the day was spent reveiwing JS and our understanding of different for loops and grabing information inside of objects. We were later given a project sight to make to help improve our JS understanding for tomorrow. 

### What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

So far the biggest benifits I've noticed by making a plan first are that there is less time wasted on fixing and re-adjusting parts of the website you are unhappy with simply when a simple sketch could have saved you the headache.

### How do you find answers when you are stuck?

The first resource that I would go to are the TA's however if I am doing homework after school the next best thing would be google. The answer for almost any question I have about my broken code can be found on google.

### From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

Currently my biggest takeaways are that for the most part I understand the mindset that is needed to be a programmer however it needs more effort constantly than I was expecting. Most jobs that I had before only required your effort or dedication while you were there. Currently it feels like a career as a programmer is more of a lifestile than just a job that you need to develop a skill for.
