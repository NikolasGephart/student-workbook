## Overview of Day
 This morning had a bit of a different kind of start to it. This morning started with some whiteboard challenges. The first one was solved fairly easily and quickly by our team (go team 3) while the second problem used up a lot more mental bandwidth than was expected. We ended up coming up with an overly complicated but still kinda correct solution. The actual solution was still clever and fun to hear too. The rest of the day was spent reveiwing JS and our understanding of different for loops and grabing information inside of objects. We were later given a project sight to make to help improve our JS understanding for tomorrow.
