## Overview of Day

In the morning we discussed how a sprint is planned in order to effectively make progress on a project. After talking about sprints we learned about JS basics and how to link the JS page to our main.html(it's the same as with css *shhhhhhh*). We were then given some JS challenges to complete.

### What is Scope ?
Scope is how much that particular variable or function can affect or be present in the code. Ex. Var, Let, and Const.
Some can only affect the code inside of a function while others are global affecting all the code.

### What is Hoisting ?
Hoisting is making sure that the variable that you are about to be calling even exists yet, even if it dosen't have a value at the moment.

### In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Let is great for defineing a variable within a block that you wish to keep isolated. Code outside of the block will not know that the let variable even exists. Const is like an incognito version of let because it can neither be updated or redeclared allowing you to use that particular variable once then decare a different variable with the same name later without error. Var sets the variable to have a global scope, meaning once declared it can be refrenced anywhere in the code and still return that value.
