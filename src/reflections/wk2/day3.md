## Overview of Day


  This morning's starter challenge was slightly easier than most days' because it was the same as one of the questions from the technical interview. 

### Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

### What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.


### Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
