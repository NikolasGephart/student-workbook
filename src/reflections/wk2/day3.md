## Overview of Day


  This morning's starter challenge was slightly easier than most days' because it was the same as one of the questions from the technical interview. 

### Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

There are a few different ways to open the google dev tools one of which being Ctrl + Shift + I then there will be a few options to pick from which will allow you to see and adjust small parts of your code allowing you to see what those changes would do.

### What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.


You can evalueate, read printed messages, view data inside of your JS file, and test functions inside of the console. If you're trying to see what data a function or variable contains "console.log()" will display the contents to the screen. You can use these console commands in order to see data, test a function, or debug any errors popping up depending on what is needed in that moment.


### Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?


By typeing console.error('error.message'); into the console the console will create a link to where the bug was detected and display more information on what exactly went wrong.
