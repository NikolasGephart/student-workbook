## Overview of Day
This ended up being a very chaotic day for me becuse my phone decided not to make sound when my alarms were going of leading me to gain a strike after showing up late. Missing all but the back end of the class for that day # Codeworks Day 8

## Overview of Day
 This morning had a bit of a different kind of start to it. This morning started with some whiteboard challenges. The first one was solved fairly easily and quickly by our team (go team 3) while the second problem used up a lot more mental bandwidth than was expected. We ended up coming up with an overly complicated but still kinda correct solution. The actual solution was still clever and fun to hear too. The rest of the day was spent reveiwing JS and our understanding of different for loops and grabing information inside of objects. We were later given a project sight to make to help improve our JS understanding for tomorrow. 

### What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

So far the biggest benifits I've noticed by making a plan first are that there is less time wasted on fixing and re-adjusting parts of the website you are unhappy with simply when a simple sketch could have saved you the headache.

### How do you find answers when you are stuck?

I have a few different options when it comes to resources. I can either talk to the TA's in order to get help with my code or simply google the issue. Because the goal of this class is for us to become the best indipendent programmers we can be and be able to teach ourselves this is probably going to be our best resource.

### From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

There are a few things in the article that I was happy to already agree with and have as my own opinion and there were other parts where I realised that there is still a lot I can and should improve on.
