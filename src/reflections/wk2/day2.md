## Overview of Day




### What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?


let *var name* = function(*var input*) { return ;}


function *function name*() {return *null*}

function *name of value*() {}

### What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameter = value being called inside of a function

Arguments = value of parameters being called inside of a function

### What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

Because functions are also objects they can be nested inside of eachother leading to the calling of a function to look like "camera.picture.pixel()"
